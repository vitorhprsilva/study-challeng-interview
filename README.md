# React Interview Challenge.

This challenge is a React interview task that I came across on a YouTube channel, and I successfully solved it.



## Develop an application where:

- The user can click anywhere on the page.
- A small circle should be rendered at the clicked position.
- On each click, the previously created circles are retained and a new one is rendered.
- Create two functionalities for the application:
    - undo
    - redo


## Running the system.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```bash
  npm start
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```bash
  npm run build
```
